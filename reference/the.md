# Environment for package parameters

The environment `the` is used for user parameters. They are assigned by
[`init()`](https://umass-uas-salt-marsh.github.io/marshmap/reference/init.md),
which is run when the package is loaded, and also may be run by the
user, e.g., when parameter files are changed.
