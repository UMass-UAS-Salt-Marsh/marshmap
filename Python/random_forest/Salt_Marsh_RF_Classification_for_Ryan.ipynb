That said, my approach with what seems like a similar project is to separate out labeled data from unlabeled data. Then just load and use labeled data to do model training and testing.\n","\n","It appears you have roughly 105M samples/rows of total pixels, each at 140 bands. Huge. My guess you have actually only labeled a fraction of that, say 100K. It seems you should only be working with that 100K in this notebook. Maybe that is all you are doing and I have not deciphered the code below well enough. But my take is that 100K samples with 140 features should likely run directly in Colab, probably with the Pro+ version. I'd be happy to try it :)\n","\n","Another comment I leave below is that I only preprocess my data once and then store the resulting numpy matrix out to file. I then can just load this file subsequently, skipping all the preprocessing steps. My numpy matrix is going to be about the same size as yours and I can tell you it is relatively fast to load it. Again, maybe you are doing this and I haven't untangled the code to see it.\n","\n","I did not see any testing going on. It appears you rely totally on oob scoring and the training set for evaluation. If so, I believe you might want to rethink this. Standard practice is to show results from a test set. Much more reliable for what will happen in wild.\n","\n","Finally, I urge you to consider a more modern modeling approach based on boosting. It is kind of the next generation of tree ensembles.
