UMass UAS Salt Marsh Project salt marsh land cover mapping

`marshmap` is a special-purpose package for the vegetation mapping
component of the UMass UAS Salt Marsh project. This project uses UAS
(Unoccupied Aerial Systems), a.k.a “drones,” with a number of sensors,
along with field transects to drive vegetation cover models at several
salt marshes in Massachusetts.

This package supports modeling for this project. It is intended to be
run on the UMass Unity cluster using
[slurmcollie](https://github.com/UMassCDS/slurmcollie), although all
functions may be run locally if needed.

This documentation is a work in progress.

## Installation and set up

### Install the package and dependencies

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github('UMass-UAS-Salt-Marsh/marshmap')
    devtools::install_github('UMassCDS/slurmcollie')                                    # a companion package required for running batch jobs on Unity
    devtools::install_github('rspatial/terra')                                          # need this until 1.8-73 is released on CRAN
    devtools::install_github('bwcompton/batchtools', ref = 'bwcompton-robust-sbatch')   # while waiting for pull request

### Authorize Google Drive

If you’ll be getting data from the Google Drive with `gather`, you’ll
need get an authorization token. This needs to be done only once for
each user. Run the following from the Unity account you’ll be using:

    set_up_google_drive()

## Processing sequence

Here’s a brief summary of the processing sequence. See the help for each
function for details. An example sequence will be created soon. All of
these are normally launched as batch jobs on Unity via `slurmcollie`
(except for `screen` which is intrinsically interactive and speedy
`assess`).

1.  `gather` Gather the data from the source (either Google Drive or
    SFTP)
2.  `screen` build the flights database and open a web app to allow
    visually assigning quality scores to each image.
3.  `derive` Create derived images, such as NDVI (Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index), upscaled images, and canopy height estimates from
    the difference between mid-summer and early spring DEMs.
4.  `sample` Sample images at points where we have field-collected data,
    creating a data table for modeling.
5.  `fit` Build statistical models of vegetation cover with random
    forests, AdaBoost (planned), or potentially other modeling
    frameworks and report model assessment.
6.  `map` Produce geoTIFF maps of predicted vegetation cover.

### Additional functions

- `fitinfo` Displays information from the fits database on one or more
  fits, including model specification, assessment, and run statistics
  such as CPU and memory use. Can also be used to save an Excel-friendly
  text version of the fits database and to set assessment scores and
  comments.
- `mapinfo` Displays information from the maps database, including model
  used for each map and run statistics such as CPU and memory use. Can
  also be used to Can also be used to save an Excel-friendly text
  version of the maps database and set map scores and comments.
- `assess` Provide a model assessment. This is normally included in
  `fit`, but `assess` may be called separately to assess the fit of a
  model built on one or more sites and applied to other sites.
- `flights_report` Creates a report on on orthoimages for all sites,
  including a summary for each site, a list of files flagged for repair
  in `screen`, a list of duplicated portable names for each site, and a
  list of all files for each site.
- `build_flights_db` Builds the flights database for a site, necessary
  after new files are downloaded with `gather`. This is normally called
  by `screen` when you first view a site, so there’s no need to call it
  manually unless you are unable or unwilling to run `screen`.
- `find_orthos(site, descrip)` Returns a data frame of file names and
  portable names matched by one or more file names, portable names,
  search names, or regular expressions of file names or portable names
  for a given site. You can use this to refine name designations and be
  sure you’re getting what you want.

### `slurmcollie` functions

See [slurmcollie](https://github.com/UMassCDS/slurmcollie) for details.

- `info()` Shows the status of jobs you’ve launched
- `showlog(job)` Shows the log of a running or finished job
- `kill(jobs)` Kill one or more jobs you didn’t mean to launch
- `purge(jobs)` Purge jobs that have finished or failed once you no
  longer care about them

## Image naming

UAS images (orthophotos, DEMs, canopy height models, and derived
variables) may be referred to in three different ways. Functions that
take imagery names as arguments (`gather`, `derive`, `sample`, and
`fit`) use `find_orthos` to resolve all three of these name types, as
well as regular expressions of file names and portable names. Use
`find_orthos` to try out name designations.

### File name

This is the file name assigned during image processing. Filenames
usually encode the image’s date, site, tide level, sensor, and type, for
instance `19Aug22_OTH_Mid_SWIR_Ortho.tif` or
`14Oct20_OTH_Low_Mica_DEM.tif`. File names are somewhat inconsistent,
for instance, the month may be `Sep` or `Sept`, years may be 2 or 4
digits, and some sensors are referred to by multiple names.
Additionally, some filenames follow a wildly different pattern, such as
`OTH_Aug2022_CHM_NoThin_5cmTriNN_NAD83.tif`, a canopy height model.
Files are imported from the source repositories (either Google Drive or
SFTP) with their names unmodified.

When using `derive` to create derived images (for example, `NDVI` or
`mean upscaling`), derived names are generated from the base name (or
names), with derivation information separated with a double underscore,
e.g., `x20Jun22_OTH_Mid_Mica_Ortho__NDVI.tif`. See `derive` for details.

These file names are unsuitable for use in modeling because they include
the site code and the exact date of the flight, both of which would
break any attempt to build a model on one or more sites and apply it to
others. The name inconsistencies also make them difficult to use.

### Portable name

Portable names are generated by `build_flights_db` (which is called to
update the flights database whenever you run `screen`, so if you’re
visually screening all images in a normal process you won’t need to
worry about this). Portable names exclude the site, use seasons instead
of an exact date, and force naming consistency.

Portable names for most images consist of:

`<type>_<sensor>_<season>_<year>_<tide>[.<tidemod>][_<derive>[.<window>]]`

The portable names for canopy height models are simply:

`chm_<source>_<year>`, where `source` is either `lidar` or `delta`.

Here are examples of file names and portable names

| File name                                                | Portable name                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `19Aug22_OTH_Mid_SWIR_Ortho.tif`                         | `ortho_swir_summer_2022_mid`     |
| `14Oct20_OTH_Low_Mica_DEM.tif`                           | `dem_mica_fall_2020_low`         |
| `OTH_Aug2022_CHM_NoThin_5cmTriNN_NAD83.tif`              | `chm_summer_2022`                |
| `x20Jun22_OTH_Mid_Mica_Ortho__NDVI.tif`                  | `ndvi_mica_spring_2022_mid`      |
| `x01Aug20_OTH_MidOut_Mica_Ortho.tif`                     | `ortho_mica_summer_2020_mid.out` |
| `OTH_Aug2022_CHM_NoThin_5cmTriNN_NAD83.tif`              | `chm_lidar_2022`                 |
| `x26May22_RR_Low_Mica_DEM__x19Aug22_RR_Low_Mica_DEM.tif` | `chm_delta_2022`                 |

Portable names are used for variable names in data files created by
`sample`, and they’re the names you’ll see in model assessments. You can
find the portable name for each file in
`data/<site>/flights/flights_<site>.txt`. The portable name is displayed
in the `screen` app.

In cases where portable names refer to two or more image files (because
two identical site/type/sensor/tide flights were flown in the same
season), the image with the highest score will be used. Remaining ties
will be broken by taking the earliest matching image.

### Search name

Finally, search names allow model fits to refer to multiple files in an
easily-readable format. The components of a search name are separated
with vertical bars (note these are pretty separators, NOT logical or–the
parts of a search name are conjunctive). Multiple values of a component
are separated with commas, or a colon to select a range for ordinal
values such as season or year. Modifiers (in, out, and spring for tides;
window size for upscaled variables) are separated from the component
with a period, e.g., `mid.out`. Components in a search name may appear
in any order. Each component in the search name narrows the search, thus
`mica | low, mid` matches any files with a Mica sensor that are at low
or mid-tide. Here are some example search names:

`mid.in, mid.out, high`  
`mica, swir, p4 | ortho | high.spring | spring:fall | 2019:2022`  
`mica, swir | ortho, dem | low:high | spring | 2018`

Search names allow model fits to be described clearly and concisely,
even for models that contain dozens of variables, as they often will.

[`help(search_names)`](https://umass-uas-salt-marsh.github.io/marshmap/reference/search_names.md)
for details.
