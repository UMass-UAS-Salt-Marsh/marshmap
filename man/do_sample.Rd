\arguments{
\item{site}{site, using 3 letter abbreviation}

\item{pattern}{File names, portable names, regex matching either, or search names
selecting files to sample. See Image naming in
\href{https://github.com/UMass-UAS-Salt-Marsh/salt-marsh-mapping/blob/main/README.md}{README}
for details.W}

\item{n}{Number of total samples to return.}

\item{p}{Proportion of total samples to return. Use p = 1 to sample all.}

\item{d}{Mean distance in cells between samples. No minimum spacing is guaranteed.}

\item{classes}{Class or vector of classes in transects to sample. Default is all
classes.}

\item{balance}{If TRUE, balance number of samples for each class. Points will be randomly
selected to match the sparsest class.}

\item{balance_excl}{Vector of classes to exclude when determining sample size when
balancing. Include classes with low samples we don't care much about.}

\item{result}{Name of result file. If not specified, file will be constructed from
site, number of X vars, and strategy.}

\item{transects}{Name of transects file; default is \code{transects}.}

\item{drop_corr}{Drop one of any pair of variables with correlation more than \code{drop_corr}.}

\item{reuse}{Reuse the named file (ending in \verb{_all.txt}) from previous run, rather
than resampling. Saves a whole lot of time if you're changing \code{n}, \code{p}, \code{d}, \code{balance},
\code{balance_excl}, or \code{drop_corr}. ** Not implemented yet! **}
